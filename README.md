## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher) - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** or **yarn** - Comes bundled with Node.js

You will also need a **TMDB API Key** to access movie and TV show data. Instructions for obtaining one are provided in the API Configuration section below.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movieproject.git
   cd movieproject
   ```

2. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all required dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. The process may take a few minutes on the first run as npm downloads and caches the packages.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add your TMDB API key:

   ```env
   VITE_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   VITE_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The server supports hot module replacement (HMR), so changes to your code will automatically reflect in the browser without requiring a full reload.

### Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 API Configuration

### Obtaining a TMDB API Key

1. Create a free account at [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Navigate to Settings > API in your account dashboard
3. Request an API key by filling in the required information
4. Copy your API key once approved (approval is usually instant for personal use)

### API Endpoints Used

The application uses the following TMDB API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/movie/popular` | GET | Fetch popular movies |
| `/movie/top_rated` | GET | Fetch top-rated movies |
| `/movie/now_playing` | GET | Fetch now playing movies |
| `/trending/all/week` | GET | Fetch trending content |
| `/search/multi` | GET | Search movies and TV shows |
| `/movie/{movie_id}` | GET | Get movie details |
| `/tv/{tv_id}` | GET | Get TV show details |
| `/movie/{movie_id}/similar` | GET | Get similar movies |
| `/tv/{tv_id}/similar` | GET | Get similar TV shows |

### Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_API_KEY` | Your TMDB API key | `abc123def456...` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL for TMDB API | `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` |
| `VITE_IMAGE_BASE_URL` | Base URL for image CDN | `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500` |

## 📊 State Management

### Context API Implementation

The application uses React's built-in Context API for global state management, specifically for managing the favorites collection. This approach eliminates the need for external state management libraries while providing a clean, predictable state architecture.

#### MovieContext (`src/contexts/MovieContext.jsx`)

The `MovieContext` provides the following functionality:

```javascript
// Context provides:
- favorites: Array of favorite movies/TV shows
- addToFavorites(movie): Add a title to favorites
- removeFromFavorites(movieId): Remove a title from favorites
- isFavorite(movieId): Check if a title is in favorites
- toggleFavorite(movie): Toggle favorite status
```

#### Usage Example

```jsx
import { useMovieContext } from '../contexts/MovieContext';

function MovieCard({ movie }) {
  const { favorites, addToFavorites, removeFromFavorites, isFavorite } = useMovieContext();
  
  const isFav = isFavorite(movie.id);
  
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500${movie.poster_path}`} alt={movie.title} />
      <button onClick={() => isFav ? removeFromFavorites(movie.id) : addToFavorites(movie)}>
        {isFav ? '❤️' : '🤍'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### LocalStorage Integration

Favorites are persisted to LocalStorage automatically, ensuring data survives browser refreshes and sessions. The context handles all LocalStorage operations internally:

- **Loading**: Favorites are loaded from LocalStorage on application mount
- **Saving**: Any change to favorites immediately syncs to LocalStorage
- **Persistence**: Data remains available even after closing the browser

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application implements a mobile-first responsive design approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts. The interface adapts seamlessly across device sizes.

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Device Type | Grid Columns |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| < 480px | Mobile | 1 column |
| 480px - 768px | Large Mobile / Small Tablet | 2 columns |
| 768px - 1024px | Tablet | 3 columns |
| 1024px - 1200px | Small Laptop | 4 columns |
| > 1200px | Desktop | 5 columns |

### CSS Techniques

- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used for consistent theming with `--primary-color`, `--background-color`, and other design tokens
- **Flexbox**: Navigation, card layouts, and alignment-dependent components
- **CSS Grid**: Main content area and responsive card grids
- **Media Queries**: Responsive adjustments for typography, spacing, and layout
- **Relative Units**: `rem`, `em`, `%`, and `vw/vh` for scalable design

### Mobile Optimizations

- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Optimized image loading with lazy loading
- Streamlined navigation for mobile users
- Swipe-friendly card interactions
